# The Peninsula Ballet School

### User-Centric Frontend Development - _Code institute_

---

The _Peninsula Ballet school_ website is to show potential students and parents what the school is all about,
It has five pages that contain the essential information that the client and User stories have highlighted.

My clients brief was that she wanted an **_elegant_** website, with information at a click of a button.
The overall goal is to get more new students and give information to the existing students and parents.

## Testing

Reading the user stories, gave me a good insight as to where and what the site needed to be and what to show,

- In the Teachers section, you will be able to find information on the teachers and their qualifications and also a brief description of the history of the school.
- On the Attire page is a description of the clothes (uniforms) that are needed and links to outlets/shops on a Google maps page. Here they can get directions to the physical address and webpages.
- In the Locations page there are addresses and Google Maps links to the studios. On the Schedule page there is a detailed table with Location Grade and Times, with a downloadable PDF

I used Visual Studio to make the site which has an extention called live server, this enabled me open an instance of Chrome to see live updates on what changes I have made. When I make a change to a design element, I then a look in the Developer tool that is provided to see how it works on different screen sizes and resolutions.

I used GitHub web hosting service called Gitpages to host an instance of the page, I then went through all the pages and links in the Nav Bar and footer to make sure they work, and make sure my: _target="\_blank"_ - is working as planned.

I do this for every page, and I use the different browsers, *Chrome, FireFox, Windows Edge, Safari.\*\* In each browser, I try to break the layout. In *Chrome and FireFox\*, I make use of the preset they have for mobile/tablets. On the other browsers, I resize the window manually to see their response.

I also viewed it on different mobile phone types to see how it worked.

<summary>List of Moblie devices I've tested on</summary>

<li>iPhone 4 / 6 / 8</li>
<li>Samsung J5 / A5</li>
<li>Sony Xperia 10</li>
<li>Mi A3</li>

The next stage of testing was external testing. I sent the code and the webpage into peer-to-peer code testing in Code Institute section on Slack.

### Bugs

The side scroll on burger deployment needs to be sorted out.
when you click on the wind icon the map opens up.
Links to be fixed on google:
-chef wherehouse
