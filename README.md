This is my MileStone Project for Code Ins

### Interactive Frontend Development - _Code institute_

---

Cape Towns Best bits is a webpage that helps the travels that
a) Cant afford to do all the tours
b) Dont like doing the tours and want to meet the locals and do everything in there own time.
This was highlighted in the User stories.

My clients brief was that thwy wanted an **_Young and Viderant_** website, with lists of the top 10 Places to see, thing to do and Best local quazine, with interative maps to get where they want to do.
The overall goal is to get more people to go to the places that have been mentioned so the client can charge to have a stop on the list.

## UX

### User Stories

1. When I go on holiday I really love doing things in our own time and not have to be on a scedule all the time, Like when I'm on holiday with a Tour group, Dont get me wrong, Tours are fun but just not for me. The only problem is I never sure whats the best thigs to do, or where they are, It would be nice and simple to just open a webpage and have a list of the best things.
2. Tours are so expensive I have so much more fun and save a fortune doing all the fun stuff on my own, Always do what the local love to do,

### Scope

What problem does this wegpage solve?
One of the biggest problem when people go away is that there is so much to do and see, with so much information about so many things that is becomes overweling, with this webPage We have widdleed it down to the to 30 best thing to do, 10 Sights seeing 10 adventure and 10 best places for local quine. This makes its easy for people to deside and spent more time being on hilday and lesss time reading comments on social media.
Goals and Objectives:
The Goal of te webpage is to get more and more people to the busniness that are on the list, that busniess will pay to be on the list. We has started with only 10 of each but there is room to do more in the future as we get bigger and more popluar.
The Target demegraphic is quite large as where the List of things to do and see are very bard, all ages and fitnes profiles have alot to choose from.
The platform is easy to use and informative with little delay on getting the information they need.

### Structure.

<details>
<summary>Main Page (index.html)</summary><br>

## Testing

Reading the user stories, gave me a good insight as to where and what the site needed to be and what to show,

- In the Teachers section, you will be able to find information on the teachers and their qualifications and also a brief description of the history of the school.
- On the Attire page is a description of the clothes (uniforms) that are needed and links to outlets/shops on a Google maps page. Here they can get directions to the physical address and webpages.
- In the Locations page there are addresses and Google Maps links to the studios. On the Schedule page there is a detailed table with Location Grade and Times, with a downloadable PDF

I used Visual Studio to make the site which has an extention called live server, this enabled me open an instance of Chrome to see live updates on what changes I have made. When I make a change to a design element, I then a look in the Developer tool that is provided to see how it works on different screen sizes and resolutions.

I used GitHub web hosting service called Gitpages to host an instance of the page, I then went through all the pages and links in the Nav Bar and footer to make sure they work, and make sure my: _target="\_blank"_ - is working as planned.

I do this for every page, and I use the different browsers, *Chrome, FireFox, Windows Edge, Safari.\*\* In each browser, I try to break the layout. In *Chrome and FireFox\*, I make use of the preset they have for mobile/tablets. On the other browsers, I resize the window manually to see their response.

I also viewed it on different mobile phone types to see how it worked.

<details>
<summary>List of Moblie devices I've tested on</summary> 
<ul>
<li>iPhone 4 / 6 / 8</li>
<li>Samsung J5 / A5</li>
<li>Sony Xperia 10</li>
<li>Mi A3</li>
<li>iPad</li>
</details>

The next stage of testing was external testing. I sent the code and the webpage into peer-to-peer code testing in Code Institute section on Slack.
