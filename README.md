This is my MileStone Project for Code Ins

### Interactive Frontend Development - _Code institute_

---

Cape Towns Best bits is a webpage that helps the travels that
a) Cant afford to do all the tours
b) Dont like doing the tours and want to meet the locals and do everything in there own time.
This was highlighted in the User stories.

My clients brief was that thwy wanted an **_Young and Viderant_** website, with lists of the top 10 Places to see, thing to do and Best local quazine, with interative maps to get where they want to do.
The overall goal is to get more people to go to the places that have been mentioned so the client can charge to have a stop on the list.

## UX

### User Stories

1. When I go on holiday I really love doing things in our own time and not have to be on a scedule all the time, Like when I'm on holiday with a Tour group, Dont get me wrong, Tours are fun but just not for me. The only problem is I never sure whats the best thigs to do, or where they are, It would be nice and simple to just open a webpage and have a list of the best things.
2. Tours are so expensive I have so much more fun and save a fortune doing all the fun stuff on my own, Always do what the local love to do,

### Scope

What problem does this wegpage solve?
One of the biggest problem when people go away is that there is so much to do and see, with so much information about so many things that is becomes overweling, with this webPage We have widdleed it down to the to 30 best thing to do, 10 Sights seeing 10 adventure and 10 best places for local quine. This makes its easy for people to deside and spent more time being on hilday and lesss time reading comments on social media.
Goals and Objectives:
The Goal of te webpage is to get more and more people to the busniness that are on the list, that busniess will pay to be on the list. We has started with only 10 of each but there is room to do more in the future as we get bigger and more popluar.
The Target demegraphic is quite large as where the List of things to do and see are very bard, all ages and fitnes profiles have alot to choose from.
The platform is easy to use and informative with little delay on getting the information they need.

### Structure.

<details>
<summary>Main Page (index.html)</summary><br> 
The main page the first thing you see, there are 3 links with Sights, adventure and foodies, they take you to a list with the items on them that you can choose to see or do.

## Testing

The testing was done on a step by step basis. As I implemented a new part of the site I tested if on the live server.
I tested all the HTML with w3 Validator
and did the same with Css w3 Validator

after all the JavaScript was compleated, I would go through the code and make sure if was working as smothey as possable.
Once I have put all the element in there places and working I went through all the Items and made sure they where all working correctly.
I test the speed to see how fast if loaded from uncashed browers and cached browers, with the speed availble on Chrome develpers Tools. I was able to turn down the speed to: Slow 3G / Fast 3G / Online.
Wish each speed I test performance on Img loading, HTML and CSS time, and  JavaScript and JQary CDN. Cached and uncached memory.
Then I started the the Media Quary Test and all the Presets in Chrome and FireFox Develpment tools. Once I fixed all the Bugs I send It to the SLack Comunity for Feedback.
